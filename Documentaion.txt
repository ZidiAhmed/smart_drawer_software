### Project: Smart Drawer Software

#### Overview:

The Smart Drawer Software is designed to capture images through a video camera, apply a pencil sketch effect, and save the stylized images at regular intervals. The project uses OpenCV for video processing, face detection, and sketch effect, and includes additional features like text annotations.

```

#### Usage:

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.11 recommended).
   - Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if any).

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute `main.py` to start the Smart Drawer Software.
   - Press 'q' to exit the application.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Adjust parameters in `main.py` if needed (e.g., camera index, sketch effect parameters).

4. **Output:**
   - Stylized images will be saved in the `images` folder.

#### Additional Notes:

- Face recognition functionality can be added by populating the `known_faces` folder and modifying the code accordingly.
- Ensure the required pre-trained models, such as `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`, are available.
